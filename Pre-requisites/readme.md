# Prerequistes

To enable a smooth lab experience, we require you to have completed some pre-workshops activities.

### Create / have access to 3 environments

@daiasjose08
Depending on your employer, you may have the environments already, but the enviornments do need to be seperate to your current environments to prevent inadverdent moving of solutions around and corruption

Microsoft provides all users the ability to have 3 developer environments which are perfect for our lab.

## Create Azure DevOps

For Azure DevOps use the same Microsoft account which you used to create your Developer environments. If you already have an Azure DevOps organization you can skip part 1 and directly create a new project in your existing organization.

### Create Azure DevOps organization

 1. As a first step we need an Azure subscription, you can either use an existing one or sign up for the free Azure subscription here which will additionally give you $200 for 30 days (not needed for this lab): <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account>

 2. Fill out the sign up form, you will need a credit card for authentication but Microsoft will not charge you unless you change the subscription to pay-as-you-go after your credits are used. Azure DevOps will not consume any credits.
 3. After your account is created go to <https://portal.azure.com/> and log in. Afterwards search for "Azure DevOps" in the global search and select "Azure DevOps organizations".

## Install VS Code

VS Code is a code editor provided by Microsoft which we will use to complete some automated testing.

1. Navigate to <https://code.visualstudio.com/download> and download and install VSCode version appropriate for your machine.

## Import a sample solution and data

To accomodate our lab, we will re-use a solution that has been prepared for you. This will be set up in your Developer environment and moved through the environments by the pipelines you create in the lab.

1. Download the unmanaged solution for a Accomodation listing app from <https://linked365.blog/CPSDevOpsSolution_1_0_0_3.zip>
2. Download the data files from <https://linked365.blog/Listing_Files.zip> and extract the files into a folder.
3. Import the Solution in your Developer Environment

    1. Go to Make.powerapps.com and ensure the selected environment is your Developer Environment (1)
